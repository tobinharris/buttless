h1. Buttless

Buttless lets you design an API, generate docs, and develop against it in minutes. No need to have your back end ready. 

It came about because we often have to develop an iPhone app or web site without having the backend API or in place yet. 

With Buttless, you can do the following pretty quickly:

# Define an API (resources, methods, parameters) using a simple YAML file
# Define example JSON results that the API would send back
# Generate pretty HTML and PDF documents for that defined API, which include usage instructions with CURL
# Run a web server which creates a pretend backend for your API, so if you're an iPhone developer you have something to code against instantly

h2. Install Gems

Install necessary gems.

<pre>
bundle install
</pre>

h2. Generate some HTML

The API is defined by editing the database.yml file, and also the example result files in the json_examples folder. You tweak this and then generate the HTML docs using:

<pre>
rake html
</pre>

Or, you can generate a PDF using

<pre>
rake pdf
</pre>

h3. Run your API in a web server

h4. Define some tests for the API 

It's easier to write API's if you have test cases setup to cover what is needed by the client. Simply add these to the ./test/ folder and then:

<pre>
rake test
</pre>
